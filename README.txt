This is a port of the Max Externals a-dbap2d and a-dbap3d by Andr√© Sier. Kasey Pocius is testing a new makefile, for modern systems (Confirmed to compile and run on OSX for both Intel & M1, and on Linux on the RaspberryPi4 running PatchboxOS). You should delete the old Mac binaries if they don't work for you, and re-compile the packages for your system. Info on how to do so can be found here: http://puredata.info/docs/developer/MakefileTemplate
